# LandingPageProject

This project finishes the HTML and CSS Foundations section. Combine knowledge of layout and styles to recreate a full webpage. It seems overwhelming but taking it one step at a time, should be possible.

It turned out to be easier than I thought. Each step came together without any big confusion, and the biggest struggle was getting the placeholder image to go where I wanted it to. The inspector on Chrome helped a bunch to make sure I had my layout divided as I hoped. Picked up a lot of new tricks like rounded corners, hover, etc.
